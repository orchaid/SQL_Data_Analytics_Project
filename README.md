## **About This Project: [Data Warehouse](https://github.com/orchaid/SQL_Data_Warehouse_Project) & Data Analytics.**  

This project builds on the **Data Warehouse** framework, leveraging the structured data stored within it. It focuses on **consuming the views in the gold layer**, which serves as the final, refined dataset optimized for analytics. The gold layer data can be seamlessly integrated into **BI tools for visualization** or used to generate **comprehensive reports** for further business insights.  

#### **Project Scope & Key Components**  
This repository includes:  
âœ… **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Understanding the data, identifying trends, and detecting anomalies.  
âœ… **Advanced SQL Analytics** â€“ Answering key business and analytical questions using complex SQL queries.  
âœ… **Customer & Product Reports** â€“ Structured reports that provide insights into customer behaviors and product performance.  

By structuring and analyzing this data, the project enables better decision-making, whether through BI dashboards or direct reporting. ðŸš€
